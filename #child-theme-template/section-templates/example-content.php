		<h2>Full Service Architechture</h2>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Fully Responsive</h4>
			<p>Slider Pro is responsive by default. Not only the images will scale down, but the animated layers (where you can add any content) will be scaled down automatically as well. (Examples: all)</p>
		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Touch-swipe</h4>

		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Breakpoints</h4>
			<p>Breakpoints are similar to CSS media queries and allow you to dynamically change the slider's settings when the screen is at a certain size. (Examples: 1 and 5)</p>
		</div>

		<div class="separator"></div>

		<h3>Elegant and smooth animations</h3>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">

		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Animated Layers</h4>
			<p>Layers can be both animated and static and they can hold any HTML content. Also, layers can be scaled down automatically or with CSS. (Examples: 1, 3 and 4)</p>

		<div class="separator"></div>

		<h3>Multiple layout options</h3>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">

		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Infinite Scrolling</h4>
			<p>By default, the slides will be arranged in a loop, allowing infinite scrolling. This can also be disabled, however. (Examples: all except 5)</p>
		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Full Width and Full Window</h4>
			<p>The slider's size can be forced to fill the width or the window even when it's inside a container that would normally restrict it to expand. (Examples: 2)</p>
		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Differently sized images</h4>
			<p>Slider Pro can handle mixing landscape and portrait images inside the same slider. The images will remain fully visible inside the slider.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Auto Height</h4>
			<p>The height of the slider can be set to adjust automatically to the full height of the currently selected slide. (Examples: 4)</p>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Customizable Orientation</h4>
			<p>Both the orientation of the slides and the orientation of the thumbnails can be set to horizontal or vertical. (Examples: 5)</p>
		</div>

		<div class="separator"></div>

		<h3>Optimized image loading</h3>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>Lazy Loading</h4>
			<p>Enables the loading of images only when they are in a visible area, thus saving bandwidth and speeding up the initial page load. (Examples: all)</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">

		</div>

		<div class="separator"></div>


		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">

		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
			<h4>CSS-only controls</h4>
			<p>All the navigation controls (i.e., arrows, bullets) are CSS-only (no graphics) which makes them very easy to customize.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="service layout-1-3-3">
